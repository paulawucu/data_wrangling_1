## Import some data
I want to import "FAS_litters.csv"
```{r}
litters_df = read_csv("./data/FAS_litters.csv")  # this is a relative path
litters_df = janitor::clean_names(litters_df)

pups_df = read_csv("./data/FAS_pups.csv")
pups_df = janitor::clean_names(pups_df)
```

## Select 
Lect's select some columns
```{r}
select(litters_df, group, litter_number)
select(litters_df, group, gd0_weight, gd18_weight)
select(litters_df, group, gd0_weight:gd_of_birth)  # keep several columns
select(litters_df, group, starts_with("pups"))  # start_with, end_with, contains
select(litters_df, -litter_number)  # except litter_number
select(litters_df, GROUP = group, litter_number)  # you can still rename the attributes (just rename) 
select(litters_df, litter_number, everything())  # relocate the litter_number first, and keep everything later
```
```{r}
names(pups_df)
select(pups_df, litter_number:pd_ears)  # or just litter_number, sex, pd_ears
# pull(litters_df, group)
